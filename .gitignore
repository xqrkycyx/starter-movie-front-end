# Solve env-specific NPM registry problem
# (Pushing up package-lock.json file was causing Render
# to try installing dependencies from Nexus-resolved URLs
# (https://nexus.corp.indeed.com/) rather than the public
# NPM registry, leading to build failures due to lack of permissions)
# Fix: let Render install its own dependencies afresh
